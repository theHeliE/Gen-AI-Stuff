## **Part 1: Short-Word / Fill-in-the-Blank Questions (70%)**

1.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application behaves as expected.
2.  The goal of software testing is to identify and report **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** or issues in the application.
3.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Box testing tests functionality without knowing the internal code, focusing on inputs and outputs.
4.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Box testing involves testing with full knowledge of the code, logic, and paths.
5.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Box testing is a mix of both Black and White Box testing, where the tester has partial knowledge of the system internals.
6.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Testing has the smallest scope and tests individual functions or methods in the code.
7.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Testing checks how modules or components work together.
8.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Testing validates the complete integrated system against requirements.
9.  **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Testing (UAT) ensures the system meets business needs.
10. One common misconception is that **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** testing is more powerful than manual testing, even though automation requires a stable product first.
11. The **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** stage is the most important in the SDLC, involving the study of existing business processes .
12. **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Requirements define the behavior, functions, and features of the application.
13. **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Requirements define quality attributes like performance, scalability, and security.
14. The **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** phase focuses on converting requirements into a structured blueprint, divided into High-Level and Low-Level Design .
15. The **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** phase is where the actual development takes place, translating the design into a working software product.
16. The **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Model illustrates the software development process in a linear and sequential flow.
17. The **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Model is a risk-driven approach best suited for large, complex, and high-risk projects.
18. **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** is the process of checking documents and code to ensure the product is being built correctly (e.g., "Did we build the feature according to the requirement?").
19. **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** ensures the actual product meets the user's needs (e.g., "Does the feature actually solve the user's need?").
20. **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** (QA) is process-oriented and aims to prevent defects, while **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** (QC) is product-oriented and aims to identify defects.
21. The **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** extends the Waterfall model by planning testing (validation) in parallel with each development (verification) phase .
22. In the **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** model, development is iterative and incremental, with time-boxed iterations called Sprints .
23. A **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** is a rough, early version of the software used to visualize ideas and get user feedback .
24. **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Testing means moving testing earlier in the project timeline to find bugs when they are cheaper to fix .
25. A **\*\***\_\_\_\_\_\_**\*\*** Model is a custom SDLC model created by modifying or adapting existing models to suit specific project needs .
